# QuackJack
### Final project term 2 APCS
### Pranab Islam and Remi Moon Period 1
####Description
- Initially we were going to make a program that merges voice from the user's microphone with a given beat, but we incurred too meany issues toward the end of that. We ended up concatenating audio and not merging. We had to work with bytes and messing with information in a very micro level to actually merge the music. Sadly we weren't prepared for that so...
QuackJack is the project we ended up doing and it's the game blackjack! The user versus the dealer and tries to get the highest value of cards without going above 21. Whoever has the highest value without going over wins! (We left the files for the music endeavor to prove our work!)

#Instructions
- Compile GameRunner.java and run GameRunner.java and you should be set!


##Work Log 
- June 5: We both researched and made scratch/test files but didnt commit
- June 10: Pranab committed boiler plate and framework for sound with basic functions and tools. (Mixers, clips, etc).
- June 11 12 13 : We both kept working to fix an error in the audio capture
- June 14: Remi added Recorder.java file Pranab added file streams and threads. 
- June 15: Pranab fixed some errors with recorder.java and aded beat files, as well as the wav appender class (the audio concatenator). This is when we kept trying to merge the music files so they plaed in sync. Instead we got audio concatenation with one file playing completely after the first. 
- June 16: We decided to drop the audio merging song idea and spent the whole day planning on paper how to make black jack the card game. Remi added basic basic classes such as deck.java, suits.java, and card.java that were essential to the program.
- June 17: Pranab and Remi fixed bugs in the basic card and deck classes. Pranab added player.java and GameRunner.java. These files dictated how the game would be run and played. Fixed bugs as well the whole day and finished.
