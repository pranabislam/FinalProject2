# QuackJack
## Final project term 2 APCS
## Pranab Islam and Remi Moon Period 1
**Initially we were going to make a program that merges voice from the user's microphone with a given beat, but we incurred too meany issues toward the end of that. We ended up concatenating audio and not merging. We had to work with bytes and messing with information in a very micro level to actually merge the music. Sadly we weren't prepared for that so...
QuackJack is the project we ended up doing and it's the game blackjack! The user versus the dealer. (We left the files for the music endeavor to prove our work!)
